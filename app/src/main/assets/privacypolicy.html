        <strong>2. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong><br>
        In order to use our mobile application, you will have to register and provide some personally identifiable information ("PII"). In order to provide our users with effective and enhanced personalized service and user experience, we request information about you in certain circumstances and collect certain information automatically.

Registration can be accomplished by submitting only a user name and password, however other offerings within our mobile application may require the submission of additional information.

        <br><br>
        
        <strong>2.3. Information Collected Automatically</strong><br>
        We may also automatically collect your IP addresses, device type, location and mobile application access times. This information we collect helps facilitate our users’ online experience on our mobile application. We also use cookies to track usage patterns on our mobile application and to control the display of ads, as well as to offer other functionalities (e.g. screening for age, and “remembering” you to speed up your log-in). Users can turn off cookies, but that may affect their online experience.

        <br><br>
        
        <strong>3. WHAT DO WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?</strong><br>
        We use Information you provide to satisfy your requests and improve our mobile application, products and services. We may, from time to time, produce reports for advertisers, sponsors and vendors containing anonymous, aggregate information about our users, such as demographic, age and online usage information. The Information allows us to provide content and offers that are most relevant to our users and to work more closely with advertisers. In these reports, we do not include any personally identifiable information (PII) of our users.
        We use personal information so that we may display or send custom, personalized content to our mobile application users and send e-mails, features, promotional material, surveys and other updates to our users. From time to time, we may also establish business relationships with other persons or entities that we believe to be trustworthy and whose privacy policies are generally consistent with our privacy policy (Partners). In such cases we might share and cross-reference information, including personal information about you that will enable our Partners to contact you regarding products and services that you might find interesting to you. We encourage our users to visit the sites and mobile applications of these Partners and evaluate their privacy policies for themselves.
        We also use the Information to administer, evaluate and improve our products and services, fulfil customer requests, to offer support for any future problems, such as difficulties in navigating our mobile application or accessing certain features, and to gauge user trends to determine what products and services are most popular with our users.
        We and our technical and fulfilment agents, partners and consultants follow carefully proscribed procedures to safeguard credit card data in connection with your transactions and adhere to applicable legal requirements.
        <br><br>
        
        <strong>4. HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong><br>
        Personal information is available to BLINQUI and the technical and fulfilment agents, partners and consultants who make our mobile application, products and services available to you. Anonymous information is available to our advertisers, sponsors and promotional and business partners. We share your personal information with third parties only as described below.

        <br><br>
        
        <strong>4.1. BLINQUI and Its Partners.</strong><br>
        Third parties like mobile application hosting platforms/firms, technical and database consultants, advertising agencies, order processing partners, customer service partners and fulfilment firms may have access to personally identifiable information in the course of making our products and services available. All companies working for and with BLINQUI comply with our privacy policies, and are not permitted to sell your information to third parties or to use it except as authorized by us and you, or as permitted or required by law.

        <br><br>
        
        <strong>4.2. Advertisers, Sponsors and Promotional and Business Partners.</strong><br>
        BLINQUI shares anonymous, aggregate demographic information (such as gender, age, hobbies, interests, etc.), and anonymous information obtained from cookies and similar technologies, with our advertisers, sponsors, promotional and business partners, and participating vendors. No personally identifiable information is disclosed to any of these third parties in providing these reports.
        Users e-mail addresses are not shared with third parties unless users voluntarily agree to receive information, by opting-in, from third parties. As such, we may extend e-mail offers to users on behalf of our business partners about a particular product or service that may be of interest to users, but only if the user has indicated that they would like to receive these offers. If a user wishes to receive such offers, we will not share or disclose their name or e-mail address to those business partners, but will send the user the information or offers on their behalf. As a result, although BLINQUI may receive a fee from our business partners for this service, BLINQUI sends the offers so that your personal information is never shared with any outside third party. Of course, you may opt out of receiving these offers at any time.
        Sometimes, we will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive e-mail offers from third parties not affiliated with BLINQUI. If you decide to accept these offers, we will provide, with your consent, your contact information to the third party. Through our mobile application users will also have opportunities to sign up directly with certain advertisers and sponsors to enter contests or to receive e-mail updates and other information directly from them. Third party vendors and advertisers will also use technical and other consultants. We urge our users to review carefully the privacy policies of these third parties. BLINQUI is not responsible for the privacy policies and procedures of any third parties.
        You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information, personal or otherwise, online in any community area (whether through BLINQUI mobile application or any other service available online), that information can be collected and used by others. For example, if you use chat, forums, bulletin boards, blogs or message boards, or if you post personal information online (such as your e-mail address), you may receive unsolicited messages from others. BLINQUI has no control over this use of your personal information that is shared by you.


        <br><br>
        
        <strong>4.3. As required by law</strong><br>

        a)    as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request;<br>
        b)    to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law;<br>
        c)    to cooperate in any legal investigation.

        <br><br>
        
        <strong>4.4. Enforcement of our legal rights</strong><br>
        We may also share information to (i) protect the integrity of our mobile application, Service and our property (ii) mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (iii) protect our legal rights and legal rights and safety of our users, business partners and other interested third parties and (iv) enforce our Terms with you.

        <br><br>
        
        <strong>4.5. Fulfilling your requests</strong><br>
        We may share your information with third parties with your consent or as requested by you.
